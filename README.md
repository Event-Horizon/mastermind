# MASTERMIND

Quick Python project converting one of my Javascript game projects into Python.

Download then run using:

`python app.py`

## Example

```
> python .\app.py
Wordbank: whizz,fuzzy,quick,quiff,juked,puked
Guesses left: 3
> whizz
Guesses left: 2
1/5 Try again!
> fuzzy
Guesses left: 1
1/5 Try again!
> quick
Guesses left: 0
3/5
You've used all your guesses! YOU LOSE!
```
